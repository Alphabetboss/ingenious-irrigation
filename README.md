Ingenious Irrigation 🌱

An AI-Powered Sprinkler Technician

Ingenious Irrigation is an AI-driven smart irrigation system designed to function like a 24/7 professional sprinkler technician. It monitors lawn conditions, analyzes hydration needs, and dynamically adjusts watering schedules to reduce waste, prevent damage, and improve lawn health.

Unlike traditional “smart” timers that rely only on weather data, Ingenious Irrigation uses computer vision, sensor logic, and adaptive learning to understand what is actually happening in the yard.
